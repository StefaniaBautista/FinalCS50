            <h1>Stefania Bautista's final project</h1>
            <h3>Hello, world!</h3>
            <p>My name is Stefania Bautista, I was born in 2002 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Currently I live by the metropoline area,
            although I work and attend university in the city center.</p>
            <p>I am studying Bussiness Administration, but I felt incredibly fascinated by programming and computer science even though
            I'm horrible at it. Actually my mom was one of the reasons I entered this course: she wanted to study Computer Science back
            in the 80's but couldn't because of the unsupportive family she had -and also because it was bad seen for a woman to study
            something like that, or even study at all in the very small town where she lived-. Because of this experience, she did
            eveything for me and my sisters to study whatever we enjoyed and were good at.</p>
            <p>As I said, I'm horrible at programming. I have been studying related courses for almost a year, but couldn't get to run a
            webpage without it exploding or something. Anyway, I'm mostly stubborn so once I want to do something, I can't take it out of
            my mind: this is another example of that.</p>
            <p>This is where CS50 enters in my life. I have heard about all of the languages we were taught in this course, but I wouldn't
            even dare to dream of managing to use one. But I did. It was difficult of course, and my projects must be horrible to look at
            for somebody that understands how to do these kind of things. But for me, they are all of my work during the past weeks. They
            are everything in comparison to how I started: with nothing.</p>
            <p>That's why, if somebody of CS50's staff is reading this, I would like to thank you all for the inmese work you did for all
            of us to be able to understand this topic and believe in ourselves during the travesy we went through.</p>
            <p>As it says: "Demanding, but definitely doable". When I started the course I had my hopes low because of my past experience
            with this sort of things. But now you may be reading my (really imperfect) webpage. This have given me the wish to keep on
            learning, programming or any other things, but never give up while at it.</p>
            
            <h4>Thank you, CS50.</h4>
            
            <br>
            
            
            <h3>Ley de Humedales = Wetland Law/Protection</h3>
            <p>As stated above, Ley de Humedales (this page's topic) stands for something like Wetland Law. It is not self-explanatory
            though: a wetland is kind of a hybrid ecosystem flooded by water where oxygen-free processes prevail. These are known as the
            most biologically diverse ecosystem of all. One of the most impressive things about them is their importance in climate change:
            they have mitigation effects through their ability to sink carbon, converting it to solid plant material through photosynthesis;
            and also through their ability to store and regulate water. Whatsoever, in some cases they also emmit nitrous oxide and methane,
            althought those emissions are really low in Argentina (related to the good they do).</p>
            
            <h4>Wetlands in Argentina take over more than 600.000km2, which is almost 21.5% of our territory.</h4>
            
            <p>They help us prevent floading, prevent climate change -as stated above-, and also letting us take care of the flora and
            fauna it grows.<p>
            <p>For some cultural contexts: the argentinian government has historically had a lot of issues regarding "el campo" (as a
            mostly agricultural nation, those who work on this field have gained a lot of power because of the incomes the country
            recives thanks to their labor). People related to this field live by the countryside, normally far away from the biggest
            city in the country: Buenos Aires (CABA). Wetlands also happen to be far away from the city as well.</p>
            <p>In 2020 the world had to face an almost unbreakable enemy: COVID-19. Argentina faces economic problems since any of us
            have memory. And, as any other country, our politic parties are really far away morally from one another. All of these
            factors got together last year:</p>
            <p>On December 2019 we changed political parties (from republican to democrat), although both parties gained almost 50% each,
            neethless to say, our society has chosen two different paths. At the beginning of 2020 we knew about the coronavirus, but it
            had not affected us yet. On that moment, a known problematic was already starting to affect us: fires at the wetlands (like
            those the whole world saw at California). All of these started to grow a seed in every citizen, with a lot of hatred feelings
            towards each other, planting tension in our land.</p>
            <p>When COVID started to approach us, everything went south. Some people were completely against the government, others only
            cared about the fires (that lasted for 8 months, even in national Tv they showed it counted times) because of the problems it
            would bring to our flora, fauna and economy. Anyway, with the lockdown (the largest of the world) Economy was already dying
            out there. People started to act as blind towards statistics or anything the government said.</p>
            <p>With a lot of political changes we faced on 2020, out government did not even acknowledge the inmense fires. This is where
            the law takes action.</p>
            <p>Wetlands' law have been taken to the Congress for 6 years in a row, althought it was born as a project in 2002. Even though
            it made it to the Congress last year, and the need to protect those lands is something indiscutible after all that happened,
            the political party have decided to not present it into votation and still has not put a date to it.</p>
            
            <h4>This is no new panorama for us argentinians, but, more than any other time, the need for this law is incredibly strong.</h4>
