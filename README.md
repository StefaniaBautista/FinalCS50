#### Description:
  CS50's final project! Creating a webpage about an import topic in Argentina: Ley de Humedales (Wetlands' law).
  My objective with this project is to share it not only with the CS50's staff but also with some of the people I share interest in this topic, and keep on adding more information regarding this problematic until this project is finally a law.
  First of all, I would like to say that this webpage will be almost completely in Spanish because that is the language we speak in our country. Whatsoever, the page "About" is in english.
  It should work as any other webpage, with 4 different sections:
  Blog: articules written by myself with sources cited at the end of the articule.
  Notas: articules written by a third-party, some of them will be my cited sources and also greenpeace's page about this problematic.
  Proyecto: if interested, you could see the different law projects sent to the gobervent for some years.
  About: as the title, this page will be in english. Here I will explain my travesy geeting along with programming and also a little explanation about the problematic itself for english speakers.
  See you later, world!
